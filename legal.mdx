---

## Beta status and no warranties

Ardra is in beta and may contain bugs or outages. The service is provided “as is” with no guarantees of performance, availability, or fitness for any purpose. Any feature—including bots, rebates, or perp DEX integrations—may be changed, suspended, or discontinued without notice.

## Trading risks and liability waiver

- **No financial advice:** Ardra does not provide investment recommendations. You remain fully responsible for all trading decisions and due diligence.
- **Bots and automation:** By triggering a bot (Telegram or future channels) you acknowledge that preset margin, take profit, and stop loss strategies can produce financial losses, including total loss. Ardra is not liable for damages arising from bot usage or misconfigured APIs/keys.
- **Data integrity:** Logs, leaderboards, or dashboards may contain errors or be unavailable due to the beta phase. Do not rely on these interfaces as your sole accounting or tax records.
- **Limited liability:** Ardra, its founders, and affiliates are not responsible for direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages stemming from your use or inability to use the platform.

## User responsibilities

1. **Legal compliance:** Ensure your use of Ardra and any perp DEX complies with local laws, KYC/AML requirements, and tax rules.
2. **Credential security:** You must keep API keys, tokens, and account access secure. Ardra cannot recover or compensate losses caused by compromised credentials.
3. **Acceptable use:** Do not use Ardra for fraudulent activity, market manipulation, or any purpose prohibited by connected perp DEXs.

## Suspension and limitations

Ardra may suspend accounts or bot access if it detects suspicious behavior, term violations, or operational risks. Any pending rebates or points can be withheld until internal reviews or regulatory requests conclude.

## Changes to these terms

We may update these terms at any time. Continued use of Ardra after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. Review this page periodically to stay informed.
