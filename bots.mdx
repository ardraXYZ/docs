## Active venues

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Aster - Live" icon="rocket">
    Python strategy orchestrated by `lib/aster-manager`. Store keys, write config, POST `/api/aster/start`, and guardrails handle restarts plus funding awareness.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hyperliquid - Staging" icon="satellite-dish">
    Latency-optimized connector with point optimizer toggles. UI cards are ready under `/bots/hyperliquid`, awaiting final custody validation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backpack - Staging" icon="wallet">
    Wallet–exchange blend demands dual session storage. Config scaffolding mirrors Aster so orchestration tooling stays reusable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pacifica - In design" icon="circle-nodes">
    Dual-wallet orchestration tuned for referral rotations and squad sharing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avantis - In design" icon="globe">
    Zero-fee tiers with leverage presets and liquidity guards baked in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="ApeX - In design" icon="chart-line">
    Exchange-native spreads aligned with ApeX partner tiers.
  </Card>

## Execution flow

1. **Authentication:** Pilots open ArdraHubbot, sign in via SIWS or NextAuth, and link Solana/EVM wallets exactly once.
2. **Preset selection:** Each DEX ships with an approved parameter pack (pairs, starting size, loss limits, funding alerts).
3. **Orchestration:** The backend spins the bot up inside an isolated worker, injects encrypted credentials, and turns on the log stream.
4. **Telemetry:** Fills, funding updates, errors, and stops push to the dashboard and Telegram in real time.
5. **Shutdown:** When the pilot pauses or the bot detects risk, the worker finalizes, persists the last state, and frees the slot.

## Inputs the control plane expects

- **Perp venue:** Aster, Hyperliquid, Backpack, Avantis, Pacifica, ApeX, and the rest of the supported orbit.
- **Wallets and API keys:** Never stored in extensions; Prisma keeps them encrypted at rest and decrypts in-memory per request.
- **Presets:** Define schedule, symbols, and farming intent (volume, maker rebate, funding). Squads can clone them for partner playbooks.

## Monitoring surface

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Bot status" icon="satellite-dish">
    Shows whether the session is running, paused, or waiting for a pilot confirmation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Funding & fees" icon="coins">
    Tallies cumulative funding, fees, and rebates pushed to the leaderboard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Structured logs" icon="file-lines">
    Every relevant action (order, error, restart) writes a timestamped line with context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Alerts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Risk alerts fire in the bot and dashboard; they require an ACK before execution resumes.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Best practices

- Use only presets vetted by the Ardra team or reviewed by your squad.
- Keep ArdraHubbot open during long sessions so you can answer confirmation prompts.
- Run weekly reviews by exporting logs to reconcile actual versus expected funding and fees.
