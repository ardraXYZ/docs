## Telegram bot (current)

- **Supported venues:** Aster, Backpack, Pacifica, and Hibachi.
- **Predefined strategy:** Margin per trade, take profit, and stop loss are preset. You simply configure the venue APIs, start the bot, and it handles execution.
- **Who it's for:** Ideal for pilots who are not familiar with trading or lack time to stay glued to perp DEXs but still want to generate high volume. The bot prioritizes throughput while keeping PnL impact as low as possible.
