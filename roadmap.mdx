## Platform initiatives

- **Config diffing:** Visual diffing of presets before launch so pilots can see exactly what changed.
- **Custom alerts:** Webhook-based alerting so squads can push telemetry into PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or Discord.
- **Partner filters:** Leaderboard slices for DAOs or communities to view only their pilots.
- **Self-serve custody checks:** Automated workflows for proving wallet ownership when deploying to regulated venues.

## Compliance milestones

- Integrate short-lived JWT sessions with regional data storage requirements.
- Expand login logging to include optional organization identifiers for audits.
- Provide exportable DPIA templates for partners operating in strict jurisdictions.
