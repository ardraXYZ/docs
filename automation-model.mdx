## Execution flow

1. **Authentication:** The pilot opens ArdraHubbot, signs in via SIWS or NextAuth, and links Solana/EVM wallets.
2. **Preset selection:** Every perp DEX ships with an approved parameter pack (pairs, starting size, loss limits, funding alerts).
3. **Orchestration:** The backend spins the bot up inside an isolated worker, injects encrypted credentials, and turns on the log stream.
4. **Telemetry:** Fills, funding updates, errors, and stops are pushed to the dashboard/Telegram in real time.
5. **Shutdown:** When the pilot pauses or the bot detects risk, the worker finalizes, persists the last state, and frees the slot.

## Key inputs

- **Perp venue:** Aster, Hyperliquid, Backpack, Avantis, and the rest of the supported roster.
- **Wallets and API keys:** Never stored in extensions; Prisma keeps them encrypted at rest.
- **Presets:** Define schedule, symbols, and farming intent (volume, maker rebate, funding). Squads can clone them for partner playbooks.

## Dashboard signals

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Bot status" icon="satellite-dish">
    Shows whether the session is running, paused, or waiting for a pilot confirmation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Funding & fees" icon="coins">
    Tallies cumulative funding, fees, and rebates pushed to the leaderboard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Structured logs" icon="file-lines">
    Every relevant action (order, error, restart) writes a timestamped line with context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Alerts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Risk alerts fire in the bot and dashboard; they require an ACK before execution resumes.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Best practices

- Use only presets vetted by the Ardra team or reviewed by your squad.
- Keep ArdraHubbot open during long sessions so you can answer confirmation prompts.
- Run weekly reviews by exporting logs to reconcile actual versus expected funding.
