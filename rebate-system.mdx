description: "Direct and referral rebates plus campaign kickbacks for Ardra traders."
---

- **Direct rebate — 10%:** Every dollar in venue fees you generate routes 10% back to you automatically.
- **Referral rebate — 20%:** The pilot who referred you (and likewise, you for your referrals) receives 20% of the fees generated downstream.
- **Campaign kickbacks:** When perp DEX campaigns credit Ardra for onboarding users, a portion of those campaign points is redistributed to eligible traders once TGEs or reward unlocks happen.
- **Boost windows:** Limited-time campaigns can raise rebate percentages or points-per-dollar multipliers for specific venues—watch dashboard announcements for live multipliers.

## Safeguards

- `saveImportedLeaderboard` snapshots every ingest run for audit trails.
- Only `admin` roles can approve payouts or edit multiplier tables.
- Any mismatch between venue exports and Ardra ingest triggers Ops alerts for manual review.
