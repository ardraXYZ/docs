<Info>
  Ardra is the farming copilot for anyone who wants more points with less friction. It routes venue rebates, shares referral fees without juggling links, sends part of every campaign point back to you (and to the pilots you referred), and offers bots for traders who are not confident running manual strategies.

## Welcome

Ardra boosts every layer of your perp DEX grind. Trades executed through the platform earn rebates automatically, and referrals no longer rely on juggling links: refCodes attach the moment a wallet authenticates, and fee splits flow with generous percentages for both sides. When you generate campaign points (for example, 10,000 Backpack points), Ardra captures the 1,000-point platform share, then redistributes a portion back to you and also credits campaign points generated by the referrals linked to your account.

If you are still learning how to trade or rarely touch perp DEXs, Ardra's venue-specific bots let you participate without designing your own strategy—authenticate once, pick a preset, and let the control plane handle execution and telemetry.
