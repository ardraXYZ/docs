<Info>
  Ardra centralizes bots, custody, telemetry, and the referral economy so squads can scale volume without stitching tools together.
</Info>

## Overview

Ardra is the control plane for venue-specific bots across the perpetual DEX ecosystem. Pilots authenticate once, launch automation from Telegram or the dashboard, and track funding, slippage, and referrals without leaving a single interface. These docs mirror the live experience—from SIWE authentication through leaderboard economics—so every operator knows how the stack fits together.

## Product pillars

Ardra is built on three non-negotiables: automation that respects venue incentives, a referral engine stitched into every flow, and transparent progression toward airdrops and partner rewards.

## Automation stack

Ardra links client-side agents, App Router APIs, and ingestion utilities. Understanding each layer makes it easier to extend or plug into the platform.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Client-side agents" icon="telegram">
    Automation now lives inside ArdraHubbot. `/link` commands ingest credentials once, guardrails lock beta presets, and fills stream back to chat in real time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Control plane APIs" icon="code">
    Next.js routes such as `/api/aster/*` and `/api/users/*` manage lifecycle events. Everything gates on `auth()`, spawns workers via `child_process`, and returns structured JSON.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data orchestration" icon="layer-group">
    Leaderboard ingestion merges on-chain IDs with spreadsheet uploads. Prisma on Supabase is the source of truth, while `lib/user-store.ts` snapshots protect pipelines offline.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Venue rollout status

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Aster · Live" icon="rocket">
    Python strategy orchestrated by `lib/aster-manager`. Store keys, write config, POST `/api/aster/start`, and guardrails handle restarts plus funding awareness.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hyperliquid · Staging" icon="satellite-dish">
    Latency-optimized connector with point optimizer toggles. UI cards already exist under `/bots/hyperliquid`, awaiting custody validation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backpack · Staging" icon="wallet">
    Wallet–exchange blend demands dual session storage. Config scaffolding mirrors Aster so orchestration tooling is reusable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pacifica, Paradex, Avantis, ApeX, StandX, Lighter, OUTKAST · In design" icon="diagram-project">
    Each bot ships with venue-specific taglines, referral schema, and risk rails. Ops maintains parity so switching venues keeps the same control plane.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Command center

The command center is the pilot's bridge. It exposes API-backed controls and live UI states so operators configure bots, launch sessions, and inspect telemetry without context switching.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Configuration workspace" icon="sliders">
    Wallet inventory lives in `profileWallets` and surfaces through `/api/users/wallets`. Strategy presets save via `writeUserConfig`, keeping API secrets off the cloud while diffs show exactly what changed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Runtime observability" icon="wave-square">
    Session heartbeat endpoints like `/api/aster/status` report PID, uptime, and last error. Buffered logs keep the last 1,000 lines per user, while UI cards animate via Anime.js when new data lands.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operational safeguards" icon="shield-halved">
    Launches validate config existence before touching venues. Stop commands always fire—even if the worker exited—ensuring cleanup, and login logs captured with Prisma provide a tamper-evident trail.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ecosystem visibility" icon="ranking-star">
    Leaderboard rows include referrer + referred codes for multi-hop attribution. Exports mirror spreadsheet imports so partners reconcile incentives on both sides.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Referral & points economy

Ardra rewards execution and network growth simultaneously. The same logic powering marketing claims feeds the live leaderboard and partner dashboards.

- **Direct rebate — 10%:** Every trade executed through Ardra returns 10% of venue fees. `feesGenerated` stays visible per row for reconciliation.
- **Network share — 20%:** `ReferralCapture` feeds Prisma relations so referred volume multiplies by 0.20 and stores as `referralFees`.
- **Partner tiers — up to 50%:** Tier unlock logic lives in the importer, leaving room for DAO-controlled multipliers without refactoring UI.

**Data flow**
1. Referral codes originate from `ensureUserRefCode` and attach during login.
2. Volume imports reconcile wallet identifiers with owner refCodes before computing totals.
3. Leaderboard APIs serve aggregated `points`, `feesGenerated`, and `referralPoints`, enabling instant UI updates and CSV exports.

## Data & identity layer

Prisma abstracts a Supabase-hosted Postgres cluster. Authentication relies on NextAuth with Solana Sign-In (SIWS); every session logs IP, user agent, and method metadata for auditability. Wallet addresses persist in the `Wallet` table, referral relations bind referrers to referees, and production traffic stores Solana addresses exclusively.

When the database is unreachable, ingest falls back to JSON snapshots in `lib/user-store.ts`, ensuring leaderboard updates never silently fail. Once connectivity returns, data merges back without duplicating refCodes.

### Key models

- **User:** canonical profile with username, referral code, and wallet snapshot metadata.
- **Wallet:** chain-tagged address records with custody hints.
- **Referral:** directed edges mapping referrer → referred for payouts.
- **LoginLog:** append-only audit trail for every authentication attempt.
- **SiweNonce:** expiring records that secure Solana signature flows.

## Security & observability

- **Custody posture:** Credentials captured via ArdraHubbot stay encrypted through Prisma before any venue call. Keys decrypt in-memory per request, never hitting disk.
- **Audit events:** `createLoginLog` records every authentication attempt with IP and user agent via Next headers for breach monitoring.
- **Error recovery:** Spawned processes capture stderr prefixed with `[err]`, and status endpoints surface the last message so operators know whether retries are safe.
- **Rate & session control:** NextAuth issues short-lived JWTs, sensitive routes disable caching (`cache: "no-store"`), and referral cookies sanitize + uppercase codes before storage.

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or access an account">
    Connect your Solana wallet using the SIWS flow. `lib/auth.ts` issues credentials and generates a refCode for every pilot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Capture referrals (optional)">
    Share `https://www.ardra.xyz/?ref=YOURCODE`. The `ReferralCapture` provider stores the code in cookies/localStorage until signup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch ArdraHubbot on Telegram">
    Visit [https://t.me/ArdraHubbot](https://t.me/ArdraHubbot), tap **Start**, and finish the SIWS handshake so the bot can run commands for your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link bots inside Telegram">
    Use `/link aster`, `/link backpack`, or `/link pacifica` to authorize wallet/API access. Credentials store encrypted via Prisma before touching venue APIs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch and monitor">
    Send `/run aster` (or the relevant command) to spin up automation. Funding cues, fills, and guardrail alerts stream directly into chat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review points and referrals">
    Open `/leaderboard` or your profile dashboard to monitor `points`, `referralPoints`, and fees in near real time.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does Ardra insist on local custody for bots?">
    Running automation from the pilot's environment keeps API keys and signing devices under user control. Ardra orchestrates processes but never proxies keys through shared infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are referrals linked if someone signs up days later?">
    Referral cookies persist for 30 days. On sign-in, `attachReferralIfAny` in `lib/auth.ts` binds the new user to the stored refCode so downstream imports map volume correctly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can teams audit leaderboard updates?">
    Yes. Import jobs persist raw files, normalize identifiers, and emit snapshots stored through `saveImportedLeaderboard`, so operators can download CSVs for compliance trails.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if a bot crashes mid-cycle?">
    Process exits flip the status to `error`, persist the last message, and expose it via `/api/aster/status`. The UI prompts for restart once the operator reviews logs.
