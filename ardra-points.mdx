## Season 0 basics

- **1 point per $1 volume:** Any perp DEX volume routed through Ardra mints Ardra Points one-for-one. Future campaigns and partner boosts may multiply specific venues for limited windows, so watch announcements.
- **Rebate split:** Initially, 10% of fees you generate are rebated directly to you and 20% go to the pilot who referred you. These percentages can spike during special campaigns—check the dashboard for live multipliers.
- **Campaign kickbacks:** When Ardra earns points from venue campaigns (e.g., Backpack, Hyperliquid), a portion is earmarked to flow back to participants once the campaign distributes rewards/TGE, amplifying your farm even further.

## Tracking your climb

- **Leaderboard:** View your `Total Points` (aggregate across all perp DEXs) plus the per-venue ranking and points breakdown. It’s the fastest way to benchmark yourself against the field.
- **Dashboard:** Inspect exact fees and points generated by you and every referral. You can see how much each pilot contributed to themselves and to your account, making it easy to coach or reward top performers.

## Stay ready for boosts

- Campaigns can temporarily increase `points per dollar` or rebate percentages for specific venues.
- When boosts go live, prioritize the highlighted venue to maximize Ardra Points and future campaign distributions.

## Badge system

Future missions will mint limited badges tied to Ardra Points milestones. Holding these badges unlocks valuable rewards when upcoming seasons roll out, so keep grinding and watch for mission drops.
