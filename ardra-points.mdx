## Overview

Ardra Points merge three signals—direct execution, referral production, and rebate value—into a single leaderboard row. The same math powers public marketing claims and the internal dashboards partners use to reconcile payouts.

## Direct production

- **Volume bands:** Each venue publishes a volume-to-points table aligned with its airdrop program.
- **Uptime multiplier:** Bots that stay connected for full sessions earn a boost; idle time dampens the score.
- **Symbol weighting:** Curated symbol sets prevent wash volume and focus liquidity where partners need it.

## Network contribution

- **Referral capture:** `ReferralCapture` stores refCodes via cookies/localStorage before sign-up so downstream imports can bind new wallets.
- **Network share:** Every referred pilot streams 10% of their direct points to the sponsor in near real time.
- **Visibility:** `/dashboard` exposes `points`, `referralPoints`, and last execution timestamps so squads can coach their network.

## Fee component

- **Credited fees:** 20% of each referral's venue fees are tracked in USD equivalent to show immediate ROI.
- **Tier unlocks:** Leaderboard tiers (Wood, Steel, Titanium, Diamond) look at both direct and network outputs, plus credited fees.

## Data flow

1. `ensureUserRefCode` assigns a referral code the moment a user authenticates.
2. Volume imports reconcile wallet identifiers with owner refCodes and compute point totals.
3. The leaderboard API serves aggregated rows with `points`, `feesGenerated`, and `referralPoints`, enabling instant UI updates and CSV exports.

## Best practices

- Keep your direct share at or above 60% to avoid over-reliance on referrals.
- Audit imported spreadsheets weekly to confirm wallets and refCodes match expectations.
- Coach referrals using the Network Intelligence table so they can unlock higher tiers quickly.
