## 1. Request access

- Reach us at `hello@ardra.xyz` or use the internal request form.
- You will receive invitations to ArdraHubbot and the web dashboard.

## 2. Configure accounts

1. Create your user (SIWS or email + password).
2. Enter a refCode (if a squad invited you) so points map correctly.
3. Enable 2FA.

## 3. Link wallets and APIs

| Type | Where to add | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Solana | Dashboard > Wallets | The private key never leaves the backend. |
| Hyperliquid/Backpack APIs | Dashboard > Integrations | Trading and read scopes are required. |

## 4. Pick a preset

<Card title="Recommended" icon="thumbs-up">
  Use the `Starter` preset for the venue you want to explore. It caps size and keeps the parameters conservative.

<Card title="Custom" icon="sliders">
  Squads under contract can request custom presets reviewed by the Ardra team.
</Card>

## 5. Run and observe

- Start the bot from the dashboard or send `/start` in ArdraHubbot.
- Track funding, fills, and alerts in the Telemetry tab.
- If an error occurs, export the logs and open a ticket via Discord or email.

## 6. Grow the network

After the first week, generate your referral link and recruit more pilots. Use `/dashboard` to see each pilot's output and share presets that match their goals.
