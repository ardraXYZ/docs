## 1. Connect your Solana wallet

- Create your Ardra account by authenticating with your Solana wallet (SIWS). This establishes your identity for everything that follows.
- If you received a refCode, enter it now so volume and rewards map to the right relationship.

## 2. Start farming through Ardra links

- Launch your favorite perp DEX directly from the Ardra links and execute your usual strategy. This ensures the venue tags your activity to Ardra so rebates and points flow correctly.
- Once you complete the initial session, head to your Ardra profile and register the wallet/profile you just used via the Ardra link. This step enables tracking for rebate fees, campaign points, and Ardra Points.

## 3. Monitor rewards

- **Leaderboard:** Track your aggregate points, fees, and standings per perp DEX—and compare with the rest of the field.
- **Dashboard:** Dive into your own production plus every referral's output, including how much each pilot has generated in fees and points for themselves and for you.

## 4. Automate with bots (optional)

If you struggle to generate consistent volume or hesitate to trade manually, use Ardra's bots (currently Telegram-only with predefined strategies). They ship with built-in take-profit and stop-loss parameters and prioritize high volume with minimal PnL impact. Custom strategy bots are on the roadmap.
