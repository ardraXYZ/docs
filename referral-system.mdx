## Onboarding referrals

1. Generate your referral link inside Ardra (Profile → Referrals).
2. Invite the pilot to create an account through that link or by entering your refCode.
3. As soon as the pilot signs up with your link/code and connects their wallet, they appear in your dashboard; rebates and points flow automatically once they start trading.

## Quick FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I change the percentage split?">
    Baseline splits (10% direct / 20% referral) are defined centrally, but the affiliate program can boost referral fees up to 50%. A future update will let sponsors share part of their rebate directly with the pilots they refer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there multilevel credit?">
    Today only direct referrals count. Future seasons may include layered rewards for squads that hit volume targets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where do I see each referral's output?">
    The Network Intelligence table in `/dashboard` lists points, fees, and last executions per referral, plus the fees/points attributed to you.
