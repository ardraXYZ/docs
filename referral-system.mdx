## Score components

- **Direct points:** Each venue has a conversion table based on volume, order count, and connected time.
- **Referral points:** 10% of a direct referral's score rolls into your total. Squads stacked under you make this number ramp quickly.
- **Credited fees:** 20% of a referral's net fees are credited in USD so you can track ROI.

## How to register referrals

1. Generate your link or QR code inside Ardra (Dashboard > Referrals).
2. Ask the new pilot to create an account through the link or by entering your refCode.
3. Once onboarding finishes, the pilot shows up in the Dashboard with status `pending` until the first execution completes.
