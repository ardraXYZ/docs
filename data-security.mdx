## Data stack

- **Prisma + Supabase:** Managed Postgres with versioned migrations.
- **JSON snapshots:** When maintenance or outages hit the database, ingest jobs write files to disk (`/data/leaderboard-import.json`).
- **Batch jobs:** Normalize spreadsheets, apply fees, and recalculate the leaderboard per DEX.

## Authentication and access

    Solana Sign-In with Wallet plus classic providers provide cryptographic proof of session.

  <Card title="Scopes" icon="user-shield">
    Only users with the `pilot` role can trigger bots; `admin` manages presets and data imports.

## Logs and alerts

- Execution logs stream to stdout and rotate to `/app/api/aster/logs`.
- Any unhandled error pings the internal Discord/Telegram alert channels.
- Leaderboard jobs expose a health-check (`/app/bots/keepalive`) so we know the worker is still alive.

## Operational policies

1. **No credentials in the browser:** Everything flows through the backend or ArdraHubbot.
2. **Daily backups:** Postgres dumps and snapshots live in a private bucket.
3. **Immutable audit:** Leaderboard imports stay versioned so rankings are reproducible.
4. **Preset reviews:** Every new preset spends 24h in sandbox tests before release.

## Compliance checklist

- [ ] Enable 2FA on your Ardra account.
- [ ] Review referral access every month.
- [ ] Export critical logs and store them in your SIEM.
- [ ] Configure custom alerts via Ardra webhooks (roadmap Q4).
